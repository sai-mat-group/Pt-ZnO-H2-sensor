# Pt-ZnO-H2-sensor
This repository contains the Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations done to model the Pt-ZnO sensor. 

The calculation to find the least energy surface is in the 'surfaces' folder

The calculations for the various Pt4 geometries are in the 'cluster' folder

The adsorption calculations for various adsorbates are in the 'adsorption-reaction' folder : adsorption-reaction > O-t1(or Zn-t1) > Adsorption

The various Pt4 cluster initializations are in :  adsorption-reaction > O-t1(or Zn-t1) > cluster

The Reaction energy calculations of the eight surface reactions are in: adsorption-reaction > O-t1(or Zn-t1) > Reaction_initial_final. 
[Inside this directory each folder is named as the reactant of the reaction considered]
