# Pt-ZnO-H2-sensor
This repository contains the density functional theory (DFT) based calculations done to model the Pt-decorated ZnO sensor to detect hydrogen gas. The manuscript is currently under review and is titled, "Experimental and Computational Demonstration of a Highly Stable, in-situ Pt Decorated Sputtered ZnO Hydrogen Sensor for sub-ppm Level Detection". A pre-print version of the manuscript will soon be available on arXiv. The following are the details of the contents within each folder. 

The calculations involved in finding the least energy surface of ZnO (002) is in the 'surfaces' folder, while the calculations involving the various Pt<sub>4</sub> geometries (i.e., with Pt clusters on ZnO) are in the 'cluster' folder. Calculations involving adsorption reactions considering various adsorbates on the Zn (OO2) surface are in the 'adsorption-reaction' folder, i.e., adsorption-reaction > O-t<sub>1</sub> or Zn-t<sub>1</sub> > Adsorption. The various Pt<sub>4</sub> cluster initializations are also in the 'adsorption-reaction' folder, i.e., adsorption-reaction > O-t<sub>1</sub> or Zn-t<sub>1</sub> > cluster.

The reaction energy calculations of the eight surface reactions are in: adsorption-reaction > O-t<sub>1</sub> or Zn-t<sub>1</sub> > Reaction_initial_final. Inside this directory each folder is named as the reactant of the reaction considered.
